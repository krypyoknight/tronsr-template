KryptoKnight Super Representative Budget Plan:

Other than support our staff and cover expenditures, we are distributing our budget to activities that can further the influences of the TRON Community. We will also reserve some of the capital to cover software and hardware upgrades in the future.

To make sure we can provide stable services to the TRON blockchain, we will also host at least 2 backup servers that matches the configurations stated in the SERVER CONFIGURATION sections. We have experienced engineers to make sure high availability.

Furthermore, part of our budget is allocated to incubating exceptional dApps on TRON's network. We aim to expand and populate TRON's eco-system to the best of our abilities.
